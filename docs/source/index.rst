PySubsurface
============

This page contains the official documentation for the **PySubsurface API**, a universal Python library for standardized visualization of subsurface data.

This documentation is created for both the end users as well as developers. *End users* will be mostly interested to browse
the :ref:`general_examples` pages and occasionally look at the reference documentation for the :ref:`api`. *Developers*
will find useful information on how to locally install *PySubsurface*, guidelines for adding new code and requinred code standards,
and finally a detailed documentation of the entire :ref:`api` that can be accessed by end users.

Getting started
---------------

Head directly over to the :ref:`installation` page.
